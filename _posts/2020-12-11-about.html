<p>Minecraftchest1's garage is where I post about projects I am working on and things I have learned. Comments are welcome, and even encouraged on the stuff I post. Please remember to be nice and respectful to others. And please remember, anyone may read your comments. Please no swearing or racism, or anything that may be offensive to anyone. Thanks and enjoy.</p>
