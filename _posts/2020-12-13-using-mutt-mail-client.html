excerpt: 'I have recently discovered mutt (and neomutt which has a few patches that
  haven''t made it into mutt) in my search for a command line mail client. While it
  is a simple mail client that works nicely when a Display server is not available,
  or you choose to go command line only, there are a few things to be aware of when
  using it for the first time. I have set this program up fairly recently, and here
  is my experience.
