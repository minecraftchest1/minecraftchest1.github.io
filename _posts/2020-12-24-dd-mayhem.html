  images to disk. And if you have used dd, you may have heard the joke that dd means
  disk destroyer. You may find the joke funny, at least until you have set of to the
  wrong block device. Here is the story of how I learned what dd can do.

<p>If you have used the linux command line, you may have used <code>dd</code> to write disk images to disk. And if you have used dd, you may have heard the joke that <code>dd</code> means disk destroyer. You may find the joke funny, at least until you have set of to the wrong block device.

<p>The day was December 23, 2020. Just two days before Christmas. I had previously compiled a PR for ReactOS to test it, copied it to my Raspberry Pi 4b, and configured it to share the .iso file as a mass storage device over the USB port. After rebooting and choosing USB as my boot device, it loaded the drivers and went to a black screen which didn't supprise me.</p>

<p>After trying a few times, I decided to try a more common method, use a physical USB drive. That is where my mistake came in. I verified that <code>/dev/sdb</code> was my USB drive with <code>fdisk -l</code>, formatting it with <code>parted</code>, I was ready to write my .iso file to my drive with <code>dd</code>. I ran the command <code>sudo dd if=bootcd.iso of=/dev/sda</code>. And there goes the first couple megabytes of data on my hard drive. That's right, I overwrote the boot sector, boot partition, and who knows what else on my hard drive. Woopse. Look for part 2 where I will attempt to recover the data on my drive.</p>
