excerpt: If your have installed an application on any OS, you have most likely used
  an installer. And why they are all nice and dandy, they also get on my nerves sometimes.
  Especially when trying to install apps into a folder in my home directory on Windows
  without administrator privileges.

<p>If your have installed an application on any OS, you have most likely used an installer. And why they are all nice and dandy, they also get on my nerves sometimes. Especially when trying to install apps into a folder in my home directory on Windows without administrator privileges.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are many installers that require privileges unnecessarily. The ones I dislike the most are the ones that are self contained,(relying on the files that are installed in the apps directory, or libraries that are already installed on Windows) that ask for privileges before the installer can even be started, preventing portable installs. There are others that will allow you to start it without privileges, but ask for the Admin password when you press install even when installing to a folder you have write access to. And the worst part is that many of these installers I can extract with 7z into my home folder and run without any problems.</p>

<h2>The sloution</h2>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Application installer developers should ask for privileges only when necessary. If 3rd party libraries need to be installed, the installer should tell the user that. Otherwise, if privileges are not needed, don't ask for them.</p>
