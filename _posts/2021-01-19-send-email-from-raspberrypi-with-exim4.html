    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nFollowed directions here:\n\nhttps://www.sbprojects.net/projects/raspberrypi/exim4.php\n\n \n<h2>Getting
    A Message Transfer Agent</h2>\nBefore your Pi can send emails it needs a message
    transfer agent (MTA). I have two flavours for you. The first one is exim4, the
    other one is SSMTP. The choice is yours. Needless to say, you will only need one
    of the two MTAs.\nThanks to the Debian packaging system this is easily done by
    typing one of the following commands.\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-12
    col-md-6\">\n<h3>Exim4</h3>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install exim4\n</pre>\nAfter installing
    exim4 we need to configure it. This is done by the following command:\n<pre>sudo
    dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config\n</pre>\nNow you need to answer some questions.
    Don't worry I'll give you the answers to those questions.\n<ul><li>The first screen
    asks you what type of mail server you need. Select the second option: \"mail sent
    by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail\"</li>\n\t<li>The next question asks
    for the system mail name: Set to same as hostname (raspberrypi)</li>\n\t<li>Now
    it asks you what IP addresses should be allowed to use the server. Leave as is
    (127.0.0.1 ; ::1)</li>\n\t<li>Other destinations for which mail is accepted: raspberrypi</li>\n\t<li>Machines
    to relay mail for: Leave blank.</li>\n\t<li>IP address or host name of outgoing
    smarthost: Replace by: smtp.gmail.com::587</li>\n\t<li>Hide local mail name in
    outgoing mail: Select: No</li>\n\t<li>Keep number of DNS-queries minimal: Select:
    No</li>\n\t<li>Delivery method for local mail: Select: \"Maildir format in home
    directory\"</li>\n\t<li>Split configuration into small files: Select: No</li>\n\t<li>Root
    and postmaster mail recipient: Enter: pi</li>\n</ul>\nAfter answering all these
    questions exim4 will restart and we're halfway home.\n\nNow you'll have to enter
    your account details. As root, edit the fileÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">/etc/exim4/passwd.client</span>Â and
    add the next three lines at the end of the file.\n<pre>gmail-smtp.l.google.com:YOU@gmail.com:PASSWORD\n*.google.com:YOU@gmail.com:PASSWORD\nsmtp.gmail.com:YOU@gmail.com:PASSWORD\n</pre>\nNeedless
    to say that you'll have to changeÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">YOU</span>Â to
    your Gmail login name, andÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">PASSWORD</span>Â to your
    password on all three lines. After that you only have to update and restart exim4
    and you're done! The next two lines will do that for you:\n<pre>sudo update-exim4.conf\nsudo
    service exim4 restart\n</pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-12 col-md-6\">\n<h3>SSMTP</h3>\n<pre>sudo
    apt-get install ssmtp mailutils mpack\n</pre>\nNow edit the fileÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf</span>Â as
    root and add the next lines. Please note that some of the lines already exist
    and may need to be changed. Others don't exist yet and need to be added to the
    end of the file.\n<pre>mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587\nhostname=ENTER YOUR RPI'S HOST
    NAME HERE\nAuthUser=YOU@gmail.com\nAuthPass=PASSWORD\nuseSTARTTLS=YES\n</pre>\nAgain
    you'll have to replaceÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">YOU</span>Â with your gmail
    login name andÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">PASSWORD</span>with your (application
    specific) gmail password.\nAfter this you're done. You don't even have to restart
    the SSMTP server (in fact, there is none).\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>The Final Touches</h2>\nSome
    processes, for instance crontabs, can send mails to root or other system users.
    If you don't want to miss any of them you can setup some aliases. You can do that
    by editing the fileÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">/etc/aliases</span>. Here's what
    mine looks like:\n<pre># /etc/aliases\nmailer-daemon: postmaster\npostmaster:
    root\nnobody: root\nhostmaster: root\nusenet: root\nnews: root\nwebmaster: root\nwww:
    root\nftp: root\nabuse: root\nnoc: root\nsecurity: root\nroot: pi\npi: youremail@example.com\n</pre>\nIt
    may be necessary to run the next command to make the changes in aliases active:\n<pre
    class=\"listing\">sudo newaliases\n</pre>\nThis tells the system to redirect all
    mail to root, while mail to root is redirected to the user pi, while mail to user
    pi is finally redirected to my own mail account. This way all system mail will
    eventually be sent to my own mail account, no matter to what local user the mail
    was originally sent.\n\nIf you are like me, you will probably have more than one
    Raspberry Pi mailing you some status information. And unless you use different
    mail accounts for all your RPis it becomes harder and harder to find out which
    one is mailing you. The next command will setup a new full name (pi @ domotics)
    for the user name pi, with which you can idintify the source of the e-mail.\n<pre>sudo
    chfn -f \"pi @ domotics\" pi\n</pre>\nPS: The aliases don't appear to work with
    the SSMTP setup. Nothing I tried seemed to work. Although SSMTP is easier to setup,
    I recommend you to use the Exim4 approach to get a more complete mail experience.\nBut
    if it is simplicity you're after, feel free to use SSMTP.\n<h2>A Better Mail User
    Agent</h2>\nBy default the program bsd-mailx is installed on the Raspberry Pi
    as the mail user agent. Every time you invoke theÂ <span class=\"inline-code\">mail</span>Â command,
    bsd-mailx is executed. There's one thing that I don't like about this program
    and that it won't allow you to send attachments with your mails.\nSo let's remove
    that program and install a better alternative:\n<pre class=\"listing\">sudo apt-get
    install heirloom-mailx\nsudo rm /etc/alternatives/mail\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/heirloom-mailx
    /etc/alternatives/mail\n</pre>\nAfter that you can simply do something likeÂ <span
    class=\"inline-code\">mail -a attachment.file -s \"Subject line\" to@example.com</span>Â to
    send an email with a file attached to it.\n<h2>Testing</h2>\nTo test your outgoing
    mail simply execute the next command:\n<pre>mail -s \"This is the subject line\"
    root@localhost\n</pre>\nThen type the body of the message, this is only a test
    so anything will do. When you're done typing the body type a dot (.) at the beginning
    of a new line and hit Enter. The mail should now be sent to root, which is redirected
    to pi, which is redirected to your normal email address.\nYou can also send a
    mail directly to your own email address if you want to, however that would be
    skipping testing the redirections.\n\nBelow you see two other ways of sending
    mail from your RPi. Both methods will send the file body.txt as message body.\n<pre>mail
    -s \"This is the subject line\" someone@example.com &lt; body.txt\ncat body.txt
    | mail -s \"This is the subject line\" someone@example.com</pre></div>\";}"
