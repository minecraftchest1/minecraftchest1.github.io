excerpt: 'I have grown up in a all windows environment, until about a year or 2 ago
  when I got a Linux laptop from my grandpa. The mobile operating systems in my house
  today are all Android, unless you count the school iPads (which I strongly dislike).
  I have also used Macbooks (which are almost an entirely different beast from iPads)
  last year, also for school. That puts me in a good position to compare and contrast
  these operating systems.

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 id="Windows-VS.-Linux">Windows VS. Linux</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Comparing Windows to Linux is like comparing Houses to Skyscrapers. They both run apps and have a kernel (that not so little binary that makes all the magic happen). There is not to much to compare. But here is an attempt.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>User interface</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Windows is a GUI based OS. While some stuff can be done from cmd.exe, or more recently, powershell, unless you are using windows server core and Microsoft products, you are going to be forced to use a GUI. Linux, on the other hand, is driven from the command line with graphical interfaces built on top of linux commands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Usability</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Windows is fairly easy to use. Linux is harder to judge, depending on what tools you have. If you install a desktop environment such as Gnome, KDE, or Xfce, you get many GUI based tools. If you are a hardcore command line user, there are also many console driven applications available as well. You can also go modifying configuration files directly as many are plain text files.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Customizability</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Being closed source, to customize Windows, you are limited to either to using what Microsoft has allowed, or reverse engineering. Linux, on the other hand, has infinite flexibility. Do what you want with it. If you wan't, you could even make it run on your washing machine or microwave. Someone has even ported it to play station.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Newbe friendliness</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Windows is fairly friendly to new users. Linux depends on what environment you have set up. When running a fairly complete desktop environment such as Gnome, KDE, or a fork of one of these, there are generally several tools that are included that can help all users. Plus, it is very easy to create configuration tools for linux because of it's design. While windows does provide some GUI tools, they may not be as friendly as Linux tools, and there are not many alternatives</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>App compatibility</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Windows is the most popular OS therefore many apps (and drivers) are written for windows first (oftentimes only for Windows). However, many apps are written for Linux (many of these apps are written for Linux first, then ported to Windows (or sometimes just work on Windows without much tinkering) by the community. Therefore, you should make sure that the apps you want work on your chosen OS. However, utilities such as cwygen (Linux on Windows) and Winehq (Windows on Linux) help with compatibility. However, you still need to ensure they work.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>My opinion</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I personally love Linux. However  I like Windows as well. I will not say one is better then another without knowing the intended use case (at which point I would say better for...). I feel that each OS has their own strengths and weaknesses. Personally, unless somthing works better on Windows, I would stick with Linux, but everyone is different.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 id="Windows-VS.-MacOS">Windows VS. MacOS</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Comparing Windows to MacOS is similar to comparing Windows to Linux, however, MacOS is easier to compare with as there is no Varity.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>User interface</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both Windows and MacOS are designed to be driven with a GUI. Both have command line tools available. However these tools may not be as complete as the GUI counterparts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Usability</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Both Windows and MacOS are fairly user friendly. However, users coming to MacOS are likely to be confused for a bit due to the big differences in user interfaces.</p>
