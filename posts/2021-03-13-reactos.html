<p>ReactOS is an open source rewrite of windows, by the open source community. The goal is to have an open source OS that can run windows apps and drivers, without modification. While it is not complete, it is moving along at a steady pace. If you would like to help, the project is looking for both kernel developers (drivers and stuff), as well as user mode developers.
