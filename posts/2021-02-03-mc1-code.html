<p>Mc1 code is a QR code based alternative for generating scannable codes. The system works with three colors (representing 1, 2, and 3) which are chosen by the creator of the code. While any three colors that are do not look similar (multiple shades of one color for example) can be used, I will assume Black, White, and Blue in my examples. </p>

<h2>Alignment Square</h2>

<p>Every MC1 code must have exactly 1 alignment square which is put at the top left of the code as seen in the image below.</p>
