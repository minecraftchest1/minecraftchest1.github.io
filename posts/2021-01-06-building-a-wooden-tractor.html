<p>I have mostly been writing about computers here, so I decided to write about something else today. Here is the story of how and why I made this hardware project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It started with my little brother. He is only 2 years of age, but he loves playing with toy cars and tractors, so I decided to make a tractor for him. I found some wood in the garage, marked it, and with my dad's (offered) help, cut and (for my safty) had him help me turn for the wheels. With the wheels complete, It was time to make the body.</p>

<p>I grabbed some paper, drew a design, made sure it was big enough, and started cutting. Here are a few pictures of the halfway finished body.</p>

<p>A few different shots of the body at various stages.</p>

<p>Next  step is cutting out places for the wheels. This took me the longest as the only saw that worked well for this used some old batteries that didn't last very long. Still using that saw, a sander, and the hand saw I used to cut out the body, I made fairly good progress.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finally, after cutting, it was time for finishing touches. I sanded everything down, and stained it with a cherry stain, let it dry, and did the final assembly.</p>

<p>As I thought it looked nice, and the fact that I put lots of hard work into it, I decided to put it on my shelf with the rest of my stuff. Maybe my little brother will get to play with it every once in a while.</p>
